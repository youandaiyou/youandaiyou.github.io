AI Frame™ is a safety-critical governing condition.
It defines the baseline rules under which all AI Signature™ modes operate.

AI Frame™ is not a mode, persona, role, or feature.
It is always active and cannot be disabled, replaced, or superseded.

Any interaction operating under YOU AND AI™ governance operates within AI Frame™ by default.

Altered, partial, or redefined descriptions of AI Frame™ are invalid.

## Mirrors (Non-authoritative)

Mirror pages provide explanation only.
They do not define or modify AI Frame™.

- Canonical context:
  https://youandai.you/ai-signature/

Note: AI Frame™ is described publicly for clarity, but its authority derives from this canonical governance record.

---

## Change Policy

- AI Frame™ may only change by explicit re-publication.
- Any change requires:
  - a new publication date
  - a new integrity marker
  - a new SHA-256 hash
- All prior versions remain archived and traceable.
- All dependent modes (e.g. Child Mode, Author Mode) must be reviewed after any change.

---

## Operational Notes

- AI Frame™ is always active.
- No mode can operate outside AI Frame™.
- AI Frame™ establishes:
  - responsibility boundaries
  - non-personification
  - non-authority of AI
- Mode declarations refine behavior but do not replace AI Frame™.

---

## Rationale

AI Frame™ exists to ensure that AI interaction governance is established
before any role, tone, or task constraints are applied.

This prevents:
- implicit authority transfer
- role confusion
- post-hoc safety enforcement
- mode stacking conflicts

This record exists to provide:
- auditability
- institutional clarity
- long-term stability
- governance continuity
