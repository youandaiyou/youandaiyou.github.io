## Canonical Declaration (Authoritative)

Language: English  
Role: Governing safety declaration  
Authority: YOU AND AI™  

Published date: 2026-01-07  
Declared on: 2026-01-03

The canonical Child Mode declaration is a safety-critical interaction constraint.
It must remain bit-identical to preserve authority and prevent drift.

Altered, partial, or translated versions of the declaration are invalid.

## Mirrors (Non-authoritative)

Mirror pages provide guidance and instructions only.
They do not define, translate, or modify the canonical declaration.

- English (canonical context):
  https://youandai.you/signature/child/

- Spanish (guidance mirror):
  https://youandai.you/signature/child/es/

Note: The Spanish page intentionally preserves the English declaration unchanged.
This avoids competing authorities across languages.

---

## Change Policy

- The canonical declaration may only change by explicit re-publication.
- Any change requires:
  - a new publication date
  - a new integrity marker
  - a new SHA-256 hash
- All prior versions remain archived and traceable.
- Mirror pages must be reviewed after any canonical change.

---

## Operational Notes

- Child Mode does not monitor, filter, or supervise usage.
- Adult supervision is always required.
- Child Mode operates within the always-on AI Frame™.
- Mode priority is absolute while active.
- Conflicting instructions must be refused.

---

## Rationale

Child Mode governs AI behavior in safety-sensitive contexts.
Maintaining a single canonical declaration avoids ambiguity,
legal fragmentation, and inconsistent interpretation across
systems, languages, or jurisdictions.

This record exists to provide:
- auditability
- institutional confidence
- long-term consistency
- evidentiary clarity
