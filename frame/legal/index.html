    <h1>AI Interaction Frame — Legal Overview</h1>

    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The AI Interaction Frame establishes the minimum conditions under which AI tools may be used within an educational setting.
      It functions as a declared interaction standard applied before AI use begins.
    </p>

    <h2>What the AI Interaction Frame Is</h2>
    <p>
      The AI Interaction Frame is a set of predefined interaction boundaries declared by the institution.
      It clarifies how an AI system is permitted to respond during student use, including tone, scope,
      age-appropriateness, and limits.
    </p>

    <h2>What the AI Interaction Frame Is Not</h2>
    <p>
      The AI Interaction Frame is not software.
      It does not modify or control AI systems, introduce monitoring, collect data,
      assess students, make decisions, replace teacher judgment, or provide automated instruction.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal Characterization</h2>
    <p>
      Legally, the AI Interaction Frame functions as an institutional condition of use,
      comparable to an acceptable-use policy or classroom rule, but applied at the moment of interaction
      rather than after misuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      It operates as a procedural safeguard, not a technical intervention.
      The frame does not create representations about AI capability, accuracy, or suitability for instruction.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No personal data is processed</li>
      <li>No student information is collected, stored, or transmitted</li>
      <li>No profiling or behavioural tracking occurs</li>
      <li>No analytics or logging are involved</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a result, the frame operates outside data-processing regimes applicable to software systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Role of the Institution</h2>
    <p>
      The institution retains full authority over whether, when, and where AI tools are permitted.
      Teachers remain responsible for supervision, instructional decisions, and educational outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frame does not override curriculum requirements, assessment standards, or disciplinary processes.
    </p>

    <h2>Compliance Positioning</h2>
    <p>
      The AI Interaction Frame does not claim compliance with specific regulations.
      Instead, it supports institutional obligations related to responsible AI use,
      duty of care, and contextual appropriateness.
      Child-safe configurations may be applied where required.
    </p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      The frame may be declared at any point prior to or during AI use and may be applied by classroom,
      age group, or activity.
      Its use is voluntary, contextual, and revocable at the institution’s discretion.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The AI Interaction Frame does not control AI.
      It defines the conditions under which AI is allowed to operate in an educational context.
