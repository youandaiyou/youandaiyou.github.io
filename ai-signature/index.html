    <h1 style="margin-bottom:10px;">What Is an AI Signature™</h1>

    <p style="font-size:1.05em; font-weight:600; opacity:0.85; margin-top:0;">
      A governed way to define how an AI is allowed to behave before the first response.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>AI Signature™</b> is an interaction framework that establishes boundaries, role, tone, and responsibility
      at the start of an AI conversation. It ensures that the AI responds within a declared context rather than
      default assumptions.
    </p>

    <p>
      All AI Signature™ modes operate within an always-on governing layer called <b>AI Frame™</b>.
      AI Frame™ is not a mode, feature, or product — it is the baseline condition under which interaction occurs.
    </p>

      <p style="margin:0; font-weight:800;">System rule</p>
      <p style="margin:10px 0 0 0; opacity:0.9;">
        AI Frame™ is always active. All AI Signature™ modes operate within it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <p>
      AI Signature™ does not require software installation, plugins, accounts, or technical integration.
      It works across mainstream AI systems by making interaction constraints explicit before the AI responds.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:28px; margin-bottom:10px;">What problem it addresses</h2>

    <p>
      Each new AI conversation begins without retained context. Without explicit guidance, the AI does not know:
    </p>

    <ul style="line-height:1.6;">
      <li>who it is interacting with</li>
      <li>what role it should assume</li>
      <li>what boundaries apply</li>
      <li>where responsibility lies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Many issues attributed to AI misuse — particularly in education and public settings — arise from this absence
      of declared context. AI Signature™ addresses this by defining interaction rules before the first response.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:28px; margin-bottom:10px;">How it works</h2>

    <p>An AI Signature™ consists of:</p>

    <ul style="line-height:1.6;">
      <li>a clearly named interaction mode</li>
      <li>a small number of declarative constraints</li>
      <li>a required acknowledgement phrase</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The acknowledgement confirms that the AI has accepted the declared interaction rules.
      Once acknowledged, the conversation proceeds within that governed context.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI Signatures™ may be pasted, uploaded as images, or presented visually where camera input is supported.
      No explanatory text is required.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:28px; margin-bottom:10px;">Public safety baseline</h2>

<h3 style="margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:8px;">Child Mode (free)</h3>

<p>
  Child Mode operates within <b>AI Frame™</b> and serves as the public safety baseline
  for AI use in educational, safeguarding, and supervised contexts involving children.
</p>

<p>
  When Child Mode is declared, the AI is constrained to age-appropriate language,
  instructional tone, and restricted content boundaries.
  Emotional dependency, adult themes, and inappropriate guidance are explicitly excluded.
</p>

<p>
  Child Mode is not a separate system or override.
  It is a predefined interaction mode that functions <b>within</b> the always-on
  governing layer of AI Frame™.
</p>

<section style="border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.15); border-radius:14px; padding:14px 16px; margin:18px 0;">
  <p style="margin:0; font-weight:800;">Baseline rule</p>
  <p style="margin:10px 0 0 0; opacity:0.9;">
    In public, educational, or child-accessible settings, Child Mode is the default
    AI Signature™ unless a different mode is explicitly declared.
  </p>
</section>

<p>
  Child Mode is provided free to ensure a minimum safety standard is accessible
  without licensing, installation, or technical configuration.
