    <p style="font-size:1.05em; font-weight:600; opacity:0.85; margin-top:0;">
      A governed way to define how an AI is allowed to behave before the first response.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>AI Signature™</b> is an interaction framework that establishes boundaries, role, tone, and responsibility
      at the start of an AI conversation. It ensures that the AI responds within a declared context rather than
      default assumptions.
    </p>

    <p>
      All AI Signature™ modes operate within an always-on governing layer called <b>AI Frame™</b>.
      AI Frame™ is not a mode, feature, or product — it is the baseline condition under which interaction occurs.
    </p>

      <p style="margin:10px 0 0 0; opacity:0.9;">
        AI Frame™ is always active. All AI Signature™ modes operate within it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <p>
      AI Signature™ does not require software installation, plugins, accounts, or technical integration.
      It works across mainstream AI systems by making interaction constraints explicit before the AI responds.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:28px; margin-bottom:10px;">What problem it addresses</h2>

    <p>
      Each new AI conversation begins without retained context. Without explicit guidance, the AI does not know:
    </p>

    <ul style="line-height:1.6;">
      <li>who it is interacting with</li>
      <li>what role it should assume</li>
      <li>what boundaries apply</li>
      <li>where responsibility lies</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Many issues attributed to AI misuse — particularly in education and public settings — arise from this absence
      of declared context. AI Signature™ addresses this by defining interaction rules before the first response.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin-top:28px; margin-bottom:10px;">How it works</h2>

    <p>An AI Signature™ consists of:</p>

    <ul style="line-height:1.6;">
      <li>a clearly named interaction mode</li>
      <li>a small number of declarative constraints</li>
      <li>a required acknowledgement phrase</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The acknowledgement confirms that the AI has accepted the declared interaction rules.
      Once acknowledged, the conversation proceeds within that governed context.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI Signatures™ may be pasted, uploaded as images, or presented visually where camera input is supported.
      No explanatory text is required.
